# The two Pact Sample Projects Based on pact-jvm-consumer-junit_2.11 and pact-jvm-provider-spring-mvc_2.10. 

The repo "pact-ec-app" and "pact-ec-review-service" are the sample projects to show how to use the pact-jvm-consumer-junit_2.11 and the pact-jvm-provider-spring-mvc_2.10 correspondingly. 

The repo "pact-ec-app" demonstrates an e-commerce application which depends on the "pact-ec-review-service" restful service. The former (as a consumer) requests the latter (as a provider) to provide rating information (such as a 3-star of a 5-star rating) for a product on the e-commerce website.

# How to Run It


Please see the [README.md](https://github.com/wubin28/pact-ec-app/blob/master/README.md) in the repo "pact-ec-app".
